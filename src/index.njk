        <p>My name is Quinn Tenorio! I am a Software Developer based in Golden, CO focused primarily on web and mobile application development. I am an alum of Colorado School of Mines where I earned my undergraduate degree in Computer Science.</p>
        <p>I am a Colorado native and am happy to brand myself as one. While I enjoy coding, I also enjoy hiking around the foothills and reading (when I get a chance). I've recently become immersed in collecting and caring for houseplants!</p>
